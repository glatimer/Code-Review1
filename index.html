              Throughout my life I have been inclined to learing, creating, building, cultivating, and developing. In the past, I have kept my hands busy through many different outlets including throwing pottery, baking and patisserie, cooking, sewing, knitting, gardening, fermenting, and more.

              Most recently, I have applied my attention to learning how to program with  the intention of attaining skills for website development and design. I live just outside of Portland, Oregon with my husband and our two sons.  In my spare time I can be found hiking, cooking, and reading.
