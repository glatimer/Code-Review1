        <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my life I have been inclined to creating, building, cultivating, and developing. In the past, I have kept my hands busy through many different outlets including throwing pottery, baking and patisserie, cooking, sewing, knitting, gardening, fermenting, and more. Most recently, I have applied my attention to learning how to program with the intention of building skills for website development.
